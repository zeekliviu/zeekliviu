# Hi there, I'm Zeek Liviu! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a student, but I already have a dream I'm turning into reality, called Zeth Enterprises. You might say I'm a dreamer, but as John Lennon said, I'm not the only one. :wink:

## :gear: Tech Stack

I'm into all sorts of things in the tech world, from OOP and data science to web scraping and data structures. I'm proficient in a handful of languages, including Java, Python, C#, C++, and even some low-level languages. I also have a soft spot for a good algorithm. :heart:

## :trophy: Projects

You can check out some of the projects I'm most proud of right here on my GitHub profile - they're all pinned for easy access. I'm always working on something new and exciting, so keep an eye out for updates!

## :open_book: Interests

Beyond coding, I'm deeply interested in mathematics, literature, and philosophy. I love diving deep into abstract problems and exploring the nuances of different philosophical schools of thought.

## :bulb: A Little Programmer Humor

You know what they say: How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? 512! Get it? Because we love powers of 2!

## :rocket: Professional Goals

My primary goal right now is to equip myself with all the skills and knowledge necessary to manage Zeth Enterprises. I'm studying hard and I'm determined to reach this goal, even if it's the last thing I do!

## :school: Teaching Dreams

In the future, I'd love to give back to the community by teaching computer science at my university, ASE. Inspiring the next generation of tech wizards is something that really appeals to me.

## :mailbox: Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, or if you just want to chat about code (or one of my interests mentioned above). You can email me at [zeekliviu@yahoo.com](mailto:zeekliviu@yahoo.com) or [ceo@zethenterprises.com](mailto:ceo@zethenterprises.com).

Remember, the best way to predict the future is to create it. So let's get coding!
